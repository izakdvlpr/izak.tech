  "description": "\nIzak, 17, but you can call me [Zev](https://github.com/zevdvlpr). I was interested in the _Software Development_ area at the age of 15 with the Javascript language. I started programming **bots for Discord**, but I always admired projects on the Web and especially on Mobile.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nOver time I got to know [Rocketseat](https://youtube.com/rocketseat), that's when I fell in love with JavaScript and got to know the best technologies, Node Js, React Js, and React Native and the entire ecosystem around these technologies that I work on today."
